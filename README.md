# Team-Profile-Gen

## Description


The motivation for the project included using a format for devloping an interface to create a website for a team of employees to have convenient access to emails and github profiles. The website deployed can help the everyday Manager, Engineer, or Intern find the data easily. The challenges with inquirer were definitely something that I could learn from. Capitalizing the correct letters make or break execution of the application.

## Installation

Installataion began with creating file structure including  __tests__ folder, dist, and lib folders. "Index.js" began with declaration of const and to require each of the employees needed. File writes to dist folder to create an index.html. Asked questions to use inquire to prompt questions and inputted the answers. Rendered.js generates cards by generating cards using if statements. Generating different cards is based on the answers ie Manager, Intern or Engineer. Dynamic Html is coded based on answers and will write files with FS using Bootstrap styling. 


## Usage

Run npm i to install necessary dependencies, then 'Node index' in the command-line.
